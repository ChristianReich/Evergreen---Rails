Ideas
- prayer requests are inputted and then can set an amount to have remided about each day
- the reminders will ransomly pick prayer requests from your list until all have been run through once
- after that the list will reset and start over

Pages
- initial home page (Info, navigation to other pages)
- Main prayer page (shows your current prayer requests for that day, button to add prayer requests, maybe some stats like your longest request or maybe have a streak system, allow the user to set what time and how many prayer requests they want to be reminded of each day)
- Add a request page (simple fill in database with info)
- Review prayer requests page (shows the full list of prayer requests you have, allows for you to edit, resolve, or show notes)

Additional things needed
- user profiles
- log ins
- alert system to send prayer requests
- system to determined what prayer requests are being selected each day
